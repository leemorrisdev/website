Welcome!

For the last ten years I've worked in a variety of mostly server-side roles, focusing mainly on JVM languages (Java, Groovy) with a smattering of C#.  I'm currently expanding into the exciting world of Go in my spare time.

I also have some experience with front end development, principally using Angular, Javascript(ECMAScript 5 / 6) and most recently, React.

Most of my career has been in finance, working on front and back end trading systems including algorithmic trading and FIX connectivity.

I currently live in Bucks, UK with my wife and Son, alongside a menagerie of animals including Horses, Dogs & Guinea Pigs.

If you'd like to get in touch, email me at leemorris2006@gmail.com
